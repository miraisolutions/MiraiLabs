# MiraiLabs

MiraiLabs is a series of data science workshops aimed at professionals.

At Mirai Solutions (https://mirai-solutions.ch), we truly believe that open source contributions and knowledge sharing are important tasks that data scientists need to take on. MiraiLabs is one small contribution towards a better future (== japanese Mirai).

Since we started, we have worked on many projects, given trainings and built extensive data science expertise. None of this would have been possible without open source and online sharing. With Mirai Solutions having turned 10 years old, we think it’s the right moment to give something back.

This particular workshop will benefit people who work with data or models on a daily basis and would like to expand or strengthen their skill set.

In each workshop, an experienced practitioner will cover in some detail a topic relevant for any data scientist’s all-purpose toolkit. Materials will be made available and shared online in this repository.
