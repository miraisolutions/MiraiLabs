### Event 2 - Sharing your data science work: Transform your R code into a web API with plumber - 29th October 2020

# Overview

In this workshop, we will discuss how to share your data science work through APIs. Specifically, we will tackle the case of providing systematic access to your R computational processes, creating an API with the package plumber. 

In a hands-on session, we will demonstrate how to transform a simple R program into a web service, we will show how to create and expose an API, and we will give an overview of best practices and common security concerns.

# Schedule

When: October 29th 2020.

Where: KV Business School ZÃ¼rich AG, Bildungszentrum Sihlpost.

What: 3-hour workshop with two short breaks, followed by some drinks and snacks. 
* 4:00 pm - doors open
* 4:15 pm - 7:00 workshop, including breaks
* 7:00 pm - drinks & snacks (~ until 8:30 pm)


# Details

In today's highly interconnected world, APIs are extremely common. Data scientists typically use them to source data for their applications, but when they need to expose their own models and data services to others, they often rely on software engineers for the task. In this workshop, we will provide you all the elements necessary to create a simple web API for your R code, without the need of programming a web application.

Some programming experience is expected. Prior experience with R and basic understanding of web applications is recommendable.

The workshop will be hands on, so it is advisable to bring along a laptop. All necessary setup requirements and materials will be shared online in the MiraiLabs public repository prior to the event, and will also be accessible afterwards.
