# MiraiLabs 2.0

In this workshop, we will discuss how to share your data science work
through APIs. Specifically, we will tackle the case of providing systematic
access to your R computational processes, creating an API with the
package plumber. In a hands-on session, we will demonstrate how to
transform a simple R program into a web service, we will show how to
create and expose an API, and we will give an overview of best practices
and common security concerns.

## Working with the project

The simplest way to start your project is right from the Renku
platform - just click on the `Environments` tab and start a new session.
This will start an interactive environment right in your browser.

To work with the project anywhere outside the Renku platform,
click the `Settings` tab where you will find the
git repo URLs - use `git` to clone the project on whichever machine you want.

### Project contents

When you open an interactive environment you will see an RStudio session with an
open project: mirailabs-2-0. 

The project contains the following folders:
* scripts. The scripts with examples that we will see in the workshop.
* adspool. A customs R package built for the workshop, resembling an adverts pool application.
* tmp. Temporary files that are generated by the examples and adspool.

The rest are metadata files that you can safely ignore for the workshop purposes.
