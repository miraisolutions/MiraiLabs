### Event 1 - From prototype to production - 24 Sept. 2019

# Overview

In this workshop we will discuss and demonstrate typical steps for moving a prototype into a production setup, along with associated challenges and benefits. We will give an overview of possible components, tools and technologies involved in a target state, while showing some of them in action with a simple, concrete use-case example. 

The example will be used throughout the workshop, to illustrate a working,
end-to-end case of moving a prototype into production.

# Schedule

3-hour workshop with a break, followed by some drinks and snacks.

* 4:15 pm - doors open
* 4:30 pm - welcome / workshop
* 6:00 pm - short break
* 7:30 pm - end of workshop / closing remarks
* 7:40 pm - drinks & snacks (~ until 9:00 pm)

# Details

Although the main topics are technology agnostic, for a practical illustration we will be referring to specific open source software and tools. In particular, the example will make use of the R programming language and the GitHub platform, however, experience with R is not required to follow the workshop.

The workshop has been structured such that it is easy to follow, with the key elements and steps demonstrated live. Materials will be made available and shared online, and we do hope to give you all the necessary ingredients to try things out yourself after the workshop!
