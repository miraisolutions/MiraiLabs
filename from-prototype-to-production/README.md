### Event 1 - From prototype to production - 24 Sept. 2019

3-hour workshop with a break, followed by some drinks and snacks.

**IMPORTANT:**

As this workshop has a limited capacity, we would like to make sure that we limit the amount of "no-shows" as much as possible. In order to achieve that, we...

i) ...ask anyone who has signed up but cannot attend, to please de-register from the event as early as they know. Similarly, if the additional detailed description below doesn't attract you, you may want to consider giving up your spot this time.

ii) ...will have a second mandatory registration on Eventbrite, which will open soon, so if you are planning on joining, make sure to register there as well, else we can unfortunately not count you in. Details on this will follow.

**Schedule:**

* 4:15 pm - doors open
* 4:30 pm - welcome / workshop
* 6:00 pm - short break
* 7:30 pm - end of workshop / closing remarks
* 7:40 pm - drinks & snacks (~ until 9:00 pm)

**Workshop details:**

We will discuss and demonstrate typical steps for moving a prototype into a production setup, along with associated difficulties and benefits.
We give an overview of possible components, tools and technologies involved in a target state, while illustrating some of them with a simple, concrete use-case example.
This example will be used throughout the workshop, such that we end up with a working end-to-end case of moving a proto-type into production. Although we will be using the R language as part of the example, it is basic enough for anyone to follow.

Furthermore, most aspects such as code organization, version control (git) or continuous integration (travis, jenkins) and deployment (docker, APIs) are universal.
Note that besides a general overview we will not manage to cover all aspects in this workshop's limited time, so some topics like e.g. the cloud will be left out.

**Workshop format:**

You are invited to bring your laptop along, however we don't expect attendees to follow live, since the workshop will be fairly dense and we will have to skip some of the steps along the process. Note that we will not be able to support individuals with their laptops during the workshop and also don't have any exercises or similar planned.

Materials will be made available and shared here, allowing you to follow the full process for our use-case example.
